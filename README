    Sorcer - OpenAV Productions

  http://openavproductions.com/sorcer

This is the repository of a wavetable synthesizer called Sorcer.


== INSTALL
To install, just run the script "compileInstall.sh". Printouts will keep
you informed of the progress.

$  ./compileInstall.sh


== RUNNING
After the INSTALL step Ardour3, QTractor, and any other LV2 host should
automatically find Sorcer, and add it to the list of loadable plugins.

If you have the JALV LV2 host installed, the "run.sh" script can be used to
launch Sorcer as a standalone JACK client.

$  ./run.sh


== PRESETS
Presets are available in a different repo:
https://github.com/harryhaaren/openAV-presets


== BUG REPORTING
Please use the issue tracker on github to report bugs:
https://github.com/harryhaaren/openAV-Sorcer/issues


== DETAILS
I've removed the dependency on FAUST to install: the generated CPP file is
included in the repo now. To tweak the FAUST code, just edit faust/main.dsp.
Uncomment the commented section in ./compileInstall.sh to re-generate the CPP
code from faust. The LV2-FAUST libraries are necessary, please ensure they're
installed.
