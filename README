    Sorcer - OpenAV Productions

This is the repository of a wavetable synthesizer called Sorcer.


== INSTALL
To install, just run the script "compileInstall.sh". Printouts will keep
you informed of the progress.

$  ./compileInstall.sh


== RUNNING
After the INSTALL step Ardour3, QTractor, and any other LV2 host should
automatically find Sorcer, and add it to the list of loadable plugins.

If you have the JALV LV2 host installed, the "run.sh" script can be used to
launch Sorcer as a standalone JACK client.

$  ./run.sh
